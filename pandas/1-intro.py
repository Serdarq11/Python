# the name pandas is coming from "panel data"
# series            vs          dataframes
# series -> one dimensional labeled column
# dataframe -> two dimensional labeled grid or table.

# think of it is like python's version of MS Excel

# What will we need to know
# variables, user input, math, logical operators, comparison operators, lists, tuples and sets

import pandas as pd

print(pd.__version__)   # 2.3.3
